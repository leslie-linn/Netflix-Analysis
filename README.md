# Netflix-Analysis
This is a group project and we has answered a lot of questions regarding Netflix.
We collected this data from Kaggle. It consists of all Netflix's movies and shows from April 2015 to March 2021 - about 15,000 movies and shows and nineteen columns describing the content. Important columns we utilized for our report and analysis were language availability, country availability, ratings, and the release date on Netflix. A lot of processing had to occur as there were thousands of null values particularly for ratings from Rotten Tomatoes - so we decided to web-scrape information from the Rotten Tomatoes website to fill that. Twitter was also web-scraped during the sentiment analysis portion of the report, up to ten thousand tweets were used for sentiment analysis.
